      <p id="intro-para">New York City is a densly populated city with various iconic sites. However, navigating in New
        York City can be stressful as it is filled with tourists and New Yorkers who trying to go on with their day.
        Therefore, I have composed my 5 underrated spots you can visit in NYC.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>1. Rooftop Park - Pier 57</dt>
        <dd>This is a free rooftop park located by the Hudson River. It provides amazing views of Lower Manhattan,
          mid-town Manhattan, and New Jersey. It is the best time to go at sunset so you can see NYC sunsets.
          Additionally, Chelsea Market is located nearby which you can get a lot of great food. Some other sites like
          Highline Park, Little Island, and the Vessel are nearby. </dd>

          alt="Rooftop" class="spotpic"> </img>
        <dt>2. Battery Park </dt>
        <dd>This park is located at the southern tip of Manhattan. In this park, you can enjoy the views of the Hudson
          River, East River, Statue of Liberty, Governor's Island, and Lower Manhattan. Additionally, you can ride the
          Staten Island Ferry for free which is in Battery Park. There are also many food trucks there where you can try
          out various hotdogs and burgers. </dd>

      </dl>
      <dt>3. Roosevelt Island</dt>
      <dd>This island is located between Manhattan and Queens and bounded by the East River. There are various shops in
        teh island and a graduate campus which is owned by Cornell University. The most special thing about this island
        is the tram you can ride from Manhattan to Roosevelt. The tram offers spontaneous views of midtown Manhattan and
        the Williamsburg Bridge. </dd>
